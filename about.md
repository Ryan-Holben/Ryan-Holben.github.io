My name is Ryan Holben, and I love solving problems.

I am a [math professor](http://www.furman.edu/academics/mathematics/meet-our-faculty/Pages/Ryan-Holben.aspx).  I firmly believe in the beauty of mathematics.

I also love [coding](/coding/).  It is both a tool and a medium by which I explore many interests.

To see my [résumé](/assets/pdf/Resume.pdf), GitHub, and so on, explore the above icons such as <i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></i> and <i class="fa fa-github"></i>.
