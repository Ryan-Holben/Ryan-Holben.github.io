Hello!

My name is Ryan Holben, and I like to solve problems.

I am currently a [Visiting Assistant Professor](http://www.furman.edu/academics/mathematics/meet-our-faculty/Pages/Ryan-Holben.aspx) of mathematics at [Furman University](http://www.furman.edu).  Prior to Furman, I taught at [UC Irvine](http://math.uci.edu), where I also got my Ph.D. in 2013.  My bachelors degree is in math and physics, which I obtained at [Colby College](http://www.colby.edu) in 2007.

Coding is a huge part of what I do.  It is both a tool and a medium with which I explore many interests.  Check out the code section of my site to see some things that I've done.
