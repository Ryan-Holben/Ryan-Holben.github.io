I am currently a [Visiting Assistant Professor](http://www.furman.edu/academics/mathematics/meet-our-faculty/Pages/Ryan-Holben.aspx) of mathematics at [Furman University](http://www.furman.edu).  I received my Ph.D. from [UC Irvine](http://math.uci.edu) in 2013.  My bachelors degree is in math and physics, which I obtained at [Colby College](http://www.colby.edu) in 2007.

My mathematical research is in the field of set theory.  My research primarily investigates infinite combinatorics at small singular cardinals, large cardinals, and the consistency results which relate these subjects.  A primary tool used in this work is [forcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forcing_(mathematics)), a technique for constructing outer models of the axioms of mathematics.  Recently I have also looked at generalizations of [cardinal characteristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_characteristic_of_the_continuum) to partially-ordered sets.

I was advised by [Dr. Martin Zeman](http://math.uci.edu/~mzeman) on my thesis "[On the Consistency of Square](/assets/pdf/Dissertation.pdf)."  This work looks at the consistency strength of the failure of the principle \\( \square( \aleph\_{\omega+1},<\omega )\\) as well as the separation of the \\(\square\_{\kappa,n}\\) principles for singular cardinals \\(\kappa.\\)  An in-depth statement about my research can be viewed [here](/assets/pdf/Research.pdf).
